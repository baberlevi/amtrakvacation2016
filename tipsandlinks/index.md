* Tech:
  * Amtrak WiFi doesn't work. First train has SSID, but can't get an IP. According to the train attendants, don't expect it t work.
  * Sprint coverage is spotty at best along route. Get 4G near big towns.
  * Lots of electrical outlets - bring a travel [powerstrip][]
  * Bring a tablet, preloaded with content, because you won't have WiFi, or likely LTE
* Bathrooms:
  * Bathrooms pretty gross and often closed
  * Bring hand sanitizer
  * Do not have showers
  * Bathrooms can stink a bit (and waft upstairs)
* Comfort:
  * It is cold at night, bring warm clothes or a blanket
  * Can lean against your backpack as a pillow
  * Bring a neck pillow
  * Bring earplugs (though the train and track noise is remarkably quiet)
  * Ride was unexpectedly smooth, until we did 80 mph, then some rocking side to side
* Stake out a table or seats in observation car early, seats fill early and people camp out for a while
* Food & Drinks:
  * Prepare to be challenged when filling your water bottle, or washing your hands. Faucets seem built to ration water by means of frustration
  * Also, water frequently runs out. If you have room to carry extra, bring it.
  * Avoid meat at breakfast due to cost $3.75 for 3 pieces of bacon
  * Breakfast and lunch in the dining car are first come first serve. Line up at door between observation car and dining car. Dinner is reservation list, starts in sleepers, then moves to coach seats, finally observation car. There will be no reservations left by the time they get to the observation car.
  * Serve weird American Beer and a couple good options in the snack car, but all the beer is expensive
  * Snack car is pricey, but you can choose a few reasonable options if you run out of your own food
* Car order: engines(2), checked bags, staff sleeping car, 3 coach cars, observation car, dining car, sleeper cars
* Observation car has great views, spend time there. Interesting people.
* If someone was enterprising, there are thousands of dollars worth of glass electrical insulators on abandoned poles along the route
* Cliff bars (or Elevation from ALDI), beef/turkey sticks, fruit strips, drink flavor packs, Mio coffee
* Not zebra cakes (kids dropped crumbs everywhere)
* Seats lean back pretty far
* There is a leg rest that pops out of the seat, and a foot rest on seat ahead of you
* Elevation gain going west may make your water bottle spray you (crack it open first, or use something without a straw)
* When you get into the mountains you'll see horizontal wires along the tracks near sheer cliffs. These are trip wires to set off an alarm when rocks fall. Hope this doesn't happen to you - it will shut down the train for hours.
* Talk to people
* Leave larger rolling size carry on luggage on lower level,  when you get upstrairs to your seat , there is room overhead and under feet for backpacks, purses, etc. (like an airplane)
* Coach tickets do not include checked baggage (but you have plenty of carry on), and they are really relaxed about what you can bring on
* Timezones for tickets: Ticket arrival and departure times are in the local timezone for your arrival or departure station.
