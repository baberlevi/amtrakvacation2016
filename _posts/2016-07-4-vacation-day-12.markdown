Up early for showers and packing. Stop at Trader Joes for train snacks. Return rental car, train shows up early (wow) and leaves right on time. We get seats together this time. Attendant on this train is realky organized. Train is staying on schedule so far through the Sierra Nevada's. Still a little snow left. Observation car is full, can't find a table for us, so snack at our seats a little. Late afternoon, find a free table in the observation car. Eat some more of our snacks. Play scrabble, and cards. Teach kids to play poker, which Wesley calls a baf guy game. Earlier taught them blackjack. Also played kings corner, go fish, and a little rummy earlier. Buy kids personal pizzas at $6.75 each, jess and I split a veggie burger for 7.25?. Eat up chips and salsa. At in observation car until sunset, pretty empty until dining car stats emptying out. Back to our seats. I watch first two episodes of Mr. Roboto, really good. Reade, and fall asleep. Cold during night. Earplugs are good, woman next to me was reportedly a loud snorer/cougher, but I didn't hear it.
