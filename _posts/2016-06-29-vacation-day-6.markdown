Boarded by female Flava-Flav look/sound alike train attendant. Toilets in our car don't work.  Little kids crying, and freezing because I gave Norah my sweatshirt, otherwise slept OK. Up at 6:30, got into breakfast. Oddly standing at door waiting a while, finally waved in. Breakfast OK, but pricey $48+tip. Seemed like pre-prepared and warmed up. Flava hollered at me for changing seats at Reno, puts me next to army/college farter as punishment. Observation car full by 10:30. I move again after everyone settled. Long tunnels in eastern California. Stop for track maintenance outside of Colfax, CA, 12:03 to 12:12. Sierra Nevada range is cool, but not as majestic as the trio through the rockies. Arrive around 17:30. Picked up rental car at Avis. Took a long to e to get car ready, but brand new Subaru Outback with 70 / 17 miles. Free drink (Lagunitas), salad,  hotwings and ribs at hotel. Room 331. Walked to Bay St and ate at pasta place for dinner. Create your own bowl, Mason full. Not sure if we asked about pesto. Walked back to hotel. Norah made a bed of couch cushions under the desk. Asked checkin person about bigger room for when we come back. Gave a free upgrade to executive suite.
