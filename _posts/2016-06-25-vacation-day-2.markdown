Early wake up, do some reading and watch the scenery.  We go back and forth in Denver for an hour and a half until we finally arrive at the station. We arrive in Granby around 13:30 (scheduled for 10:30). Great scenery from Denver to Granby. This is the time to get some space in the observation car.  Lots of tunnels (37, I think).

We met Janet from [Avalanche car rental] at the station. Janet was nice and helpful with useful tips about local grocery stores, and the normal train delays. We stop at [City Market] for groceries, and drive up to the [Grand Lake Lodge], where we take some of our groceries to an overlook and eat a light lunch. After we sit down we realize this is not really a public area (bit confusing since the lodge entrance is after the national park entrance sign), but no one seems to notice or care, so we finish up lunch and enjoy the great view of Grand Lake.  

We then take the scenic highway up to the Alpine visitor center in [Rocky Mountain National Park].  We all feel a little dizzy, and see some elk and moose along the way. Lots of short stops and walks, but we're saving most of the hiking for tomorrow.  

We drive back down to the [Historic Rapids Lodge] in Grand Lake, where we're staying. We all shower, then walk downtown to [PINE Restaurant] for dinner. They have great food, and a cool atmosphere. Truffle fries! Chilly walk back to the condo, and bed.
