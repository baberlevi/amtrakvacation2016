Early wake up, do some reading and watch the scenery.  We go back and forth in Denver for an hour and a half until we finally arrive at the station. We arrive in Granby around 13:30 (scheduled for 10:30). Great scenery from Denver to Granby. Lots of tunnels. Met rental car at station. Janet, nice and helpful. Groceries, scenic highway to Alpine visitor center (dizzy), elk and moose along the way. Drive to Rapids Lodge in Grand Lake, 4A condo. Showers, then "the pines" for dinner. Good food, cool atmosphere. Truffle fries! Chilly walk back to Condo, and bed.
