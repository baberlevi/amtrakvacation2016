Cake for breakfast.

Scenic highway to continental divide [Milner Pass] trail. Hiked 0.6 to trail the Mt. Ida trail junction, and turned back around. Lots of elevation gain in the hike. Cold mountain streams, and elk poop. Played in the snow.

Lake trail, just missed mom and baby moose.

Colorado headwaters trail, lunch, cold water.

Green something trail? Moose is still there.

Visitors center, trail.

Back to Grand Lake, Adams falls trail Norah throws bracelet, grumpy because I "yelled" at her.

Pizza, walk through shops, lake walk, ice cream by beach. Back to Condo, showers and bed. Train on Southwest Chief line hits a van and kills 5/6 (van's fault) in southern CO, Wesley upset.
