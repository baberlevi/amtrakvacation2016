Sleep in a bit 8? Egg and cheese sandwiches, pack up and drive to SF. Try to take Old Priest road to avoid switchbacks, but go the wrong way. End up taking 132 to Modesto. Gas there. Terrible driuvers! Speeding, swerving, motorcycles! Richmond bridge $5. Drive past hotel to Rodeo beach. Cold! Eat lunch at a picnic table, read signs, bridge, watch surfers, and leave again. Really backed up traffic, takes an hour to Gert in, and two to get out.  Golden Gate bridge says no cash. Richmond bridge back (no toll on return trip). After out of Golden Gate rec area, traffic is fine. Check into hotel 702, walk through public market (reminds me of place in Columbus) , eat at Hot Italian. Three pizzas, enough for us all. Good pizza, Wesley and I liked the potato and prosciutto, Norah liked the pepperoni, Jessie liked the pesto. No nuts in the pesto.
