Drove to Groveland? for groceries. Crowded store, but good selection. Bought enough food for rest of Yosemite stay. Back to cabin, made egg sandwiches for breakfast. Kids swam while we did laundry. Played tether ball. Mason made us pbj for lunch. Drive to Bridal Veil falls, eat lun and walk.  Easy trail, cool waterfall.  Drive to Glacier Point. Really good view from there, and a few spots along the way. Worth the drive. Got some shirts and popsicles at the gift shop. Drive back towards the cabin, stop at Rainbow Pools in Stanislaus National Forest along the way. Falls are nice, but lots of garbage, and college age partiers. Clearly marked as carry in/out, and no alcohol, but some broken glass and garbage. That plus deeper than expected and no life jacket for Norah makes us decide to just walk around, and swim at the resort pool. Kids swim while we make dinner.? Grilled hot dogs and cheddarwurst. House hunters and ice cream.
