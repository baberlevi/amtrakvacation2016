Up at 7:30. Breakfast at hotel. Walk to temple square. Pioneer park full of homeless. Temple square is worth seeing. Check out the convention center, amazing engineering. Lots of old white people giving tours and in portraits. City center creek mall, fountains. Walk back to hotel, laundry busy, so swim, pack, checkout at 2. Stash luggage. Walk to "The Gateway" outdoor mall. Really hot, Jess is dizzy. Planetarium $35(matinee price), lunch/dinner at "Island Grill" at 16:00, kids eat free (maybe?) $48, finding Dori ($5 night at megaplex). Walk back to hotel, hang out in lobby, play scrabble. Cab to train station $3.60/$5. Train shows up at 00:20.
