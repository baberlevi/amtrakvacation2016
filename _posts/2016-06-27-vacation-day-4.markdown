Leftover pizza for breakfast. Pack up, grocery stop, gas up rental car, to train station in Granby. Met Janet again, talk about SLC. Train about an hour fifteen late. Follow along the Colorado river. Lots of mooners. Glenwood canyon is cool, totally different landscape by Glenwood, then again at Grand Junction. Ruby canyon. Train doing 80mph to make up time. Scrabble. Stop in Radium Utah (population 8) to wait on broken down freight train to move to siding (about an hour and a half). Railroad here needs more spikes. Annoying old drunk women from NC. The DOW is down, and I cackled. Running out of water. Funny black guy (from Chicago?), maybe a chef? Finally arrive in SLC around 00:30. Cab to Home wood Suites downtown $8 ($10), lots of homeless. Move seats after a while (Grand Junction?), got to sit by wife for a while.
