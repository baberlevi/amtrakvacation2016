Up at 5 pacific. Have an instant coffee and clif bar. Mom finally replied, habeen trying to reach me during the night while phone was on airplane. Apparently having her blocked in google hangouts didn't help. Unblock her and start texting. She gets day off work from Montrose TSA and meets us at grand junction train station. Go to get rental caris a 5 passenger, no minivans available. Get a 15 passenger van for drive to Arches. Super expensive and slow gas at I70 exit. Get two gallons and drive towards arches. 5 more gallons of Gas at chevron? Camp ground, also high $3.50, then on to Arches. Few short hikes, really hot. Lots of water. Kids worn out. Drive to Moab, dinner at Moab brewery. Good food, busy little slow on service. Drive back to Grand Junction, 80 speed limit in Utah, 75 in Colorado. Drop off mom, check into Holiday Inn Express. Big room, two queens and a King. Keurig, free WiFi, nice room, smoke smell.  Breakfast, good selection, pancake machine.  Drop wife and kids at train station, I drop off car, ride to train station. Friendly guys at Enterprise. Train leaves on time.
